    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("<b>Terms</b>") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "<b>Spotify Service</b>") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("<b>Content</b>").</p>
    <p>Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the <a href="#">Spotify Privacy Policy </a> and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.</p>
    <p>By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p>
    <p>THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.

    <h4>Service provider</h3>
    <p>These Terms are between you and <u>Spotify USA Inc.</u>, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY, 10007.</p>
    <h4>Age and eligibility requirements</h3>
    <p>BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p>

    <h1>2. The Spotify Service</h1>
    <h4>Spotify Service options</h4>
    <p>We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("<b>Paid Subscriptions</b>"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>
    <h4>Trials</h4>
    <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("<b>Trial</b>"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the <a href="#">Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.</a></p>
    <h4>Third-party applications, devices and open source software</h4>
    <p>The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("<b>Third-Party Applications</b>") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("<b>Devices</b>"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions, and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.</p>
    <h4>Service limitations and modifications</h4>
    <p>We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, Spotify reserves the right to change our Spotify Service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:</p>
    <p>*The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</p>
    <p>*We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional offerings).</p>
    <p>*Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.</p>
    <p>If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of your Prepaid Period (as that term is defined in the "Payments and cancellations" section below), Spotify will refund you the prorated portion of the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.</p>
    <p>Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other Spotify Service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.</p>

    <h1>3. Your Use of the Spotify Service</h1>
    <h4>Creating a Spotify account</h4>
    <p>You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our <a href="#">Customer Service</a> team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.</p>
    <p>Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.</p>
    <h3>Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.</h3>
    <h4>Access to the Spotify Service</h4>
    <P>Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "<b>Access</b>"). This Access shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by you or Spotify. You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.</P>
    <p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your Devices.</p>
    <h4>Spotify's proprietary rights</h4>
    <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand ("<b>Spotify Brand Features</b>") are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.

    <p>You agree to abide by the <a href="#">Spotify User Guidelines</a> and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by these Terms.</p>
    <h3>Payments and cancellation</h3>
    <h4>Billing</h4>
    <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:</p>
    <p>*paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or</p>
    <p>*prepayment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("<b>Prepaid Period</b>").</p>
    <p>Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.</p>
    <p>If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. Please contact the third party regarding any refunds or to manage your subscription. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("<b>Codes</b>"), you hereby agree to the Spotify <a href="#">Card Terms.</a></p>
    <p>If you purchase Audiobook Content outside of your Paid Subscription, your purchase will be governed by the <a href="#">Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions.</a></p>
    <h3>Price and tax changes</h3>
    <p>Spotify may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Prepaid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
    <p>Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.</p>
